### Hi there 👋
- 🌱 I’m currently a Computer Science Student going into my last year
- ✨ Right now, I am learning Java, Python, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on mobile applications, web development, and any computer related software
- ⚡ Other things I like to do besides programming includes listening to music(rock, pop, rap, hip-hop, classical), playing the piano and violin, watching anime, and video games (mainly fps games like COD and Siege)
