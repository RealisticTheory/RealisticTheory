### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± I recently finished my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
- âœ¨ Right now, I am learning Java, Python, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mobile applications, web development, and any computer related software
- âš¡ Other things I like to do besides programming includes listening to music(rock, pop, rap, hip-hop, classical), playing the piano and violin, watching anime, and video games (mainly fps games like COD and Siege)
